# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

This project builds a deep learning model to classify tweets as positive or negative sentiment using an LSTM network.

## Description

The dataset used is the Sentiment140 dataset, containing 1.6 million tweets labeled positive or negative. The dataset was balanced to 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative tweets for training. The model uses a Bidirectional LSTM architecture with an embedding layer to learn text features and classify tweet sentiment.
